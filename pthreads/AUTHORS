Shlomi Fish ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ) - wrote most of the code.

Eric D Crahen (of http://zthread.sourceforge.net/ ) - Inspired me to implement
Run-Length Encoding for the lock.

Luo Lei - pointed out that pthread_rwlock_fcfs_destroy() was not implemented
, which was remedied in the 0.6.0 release. Afterwards, pointed out a bug
by writing a test case that failed (and was incorporated into the code)
that was fixed in the 0.8.0 release.
